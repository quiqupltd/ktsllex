# Contributing

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features,
please report them to the [issue tracker][issue-tracker] of the repository or
submit a pull request. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you
do so.

## Issue reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `master`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct,
  complete sentences.
* Mention the version of the hex package you are using.
* Include any relevant code to the issue summary.

## Pull requests

* Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on Github][fork-how].
* Fork the project.
* Use a topic/feature branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Comply with our [git style guide][git-style-guide].
* Make sure you are familiar with the tooling and technologies used in the
  project (Elixir, Mix).
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
  in a future version unintentionally.
* Make sure the test suite is passing and the code you wrote doesn't produce
  [credo][credo] offenses.
* Make sure to format source code using `mix format`.
* Do not to decrement the test coverage, unless absolutely necessary.
* [Squash related commits together][squash-rebase] and rebase on upstream master.
* Open a [pull request][using-pull-requests] that relates to *only* one subject
  with a clear title and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
